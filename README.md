# PWRCord
> **Low-level, feature rich and easy to use discord python wrapper**

> Important Note: At this point, this library API is considered unstable and can change without any warning!
> Unfortunately I don't have much time to work in the library Â«, but I will try to update it as soon as possible

## Features
- **Simple Low-level Comunication**
> You want to unleash your creativity but is being limited because a not implemented api feature or a new/breaking api change was released? No problem, you can easely integrate with that feature by accessing the raw payload included in every context, subscribing to the **raw_payload_received** for handling new/missing events or by using our **send_json** or **send_request** methods with custom data while we implement/work on a fix
- **Easy to learn and use**
> Decorator based syntax easy to learn. Get started and fill confortable with pwrcord
- **Worry free**
> All of our connectors/clients are ready to handle heartbeating, reconnection, identify/resume, network problems and even payload decoding, so you don't need wasting your time implementing these things
